**HI Humans:**
  This is When-the-star-falls here! I'm now a totally greenhand to the programme, and is 18 now. I'm looking forward to have a good command of programming in the future, and the first progress is expected to be made in the next two months, which is the summer holiday after the College Entrance Examination.
  What I'd like to learn in the meantime is that how to use Markdown and LaTex, which are expected to be used frequently in my college life.
  Glad to meet you here.Good luck for me!
